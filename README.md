# Todo application

### Aims
I set out to make a Todo application that allowed a user to add and delete their daily todos from a list, I also considered making it a CRUD application. In addition to this, I had also aimed for the design to look clean and not to overload the user with too many options. Finally, I intended for the todos to be persistent in the browser, made possible with the local storage API.

### Visual outcome
Desktop view             |  Mobile view

### Future considerations
In the future I would like the make this application or a different todo application that allows for CRUD, as currently it only offers Create, Read and Delete.
